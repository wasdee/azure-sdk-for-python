Storage Management
==================

For general information on resource management, see :doc:`Resource Management<resourcemanagement>`.

Create the management client
----------------------------

The following code creates an instance of the management client.

You will need to provide your ``subscription_id`` which can be retrieved
from `your subscription list <https://manage.windowsazure.com/#Workspaces/AdminTasks/SubscriptionMapping>`__.

See :doc:`Resource Management Authentication <quickstart_authentication>`
for details on handling Azure Active Directory authentication with the Python SDK, and creating a ``Credentials`` instance.

.. code:: python

    from azure.mgmt.storage import StorageManagementClient
	from azure.common.credentials import UserPassCredentials

    # Replace this with your subscription id
    subscription_id = '33333333-3333-3333-3333-333333333333'
	
    # See above for details on creating different types of AAD credentials
    credentials = UserPassCredentials(
		'user@domain.com',	# Your user
		'my_password',		# Your password
	)

    storage_client = StorageManagementClient(
        credentials,
        subscription_id
    )

Registration
------------

Some operations in the storage ARM APIs require a one-time registration of the
storage provider with your subscription.

Use the following code to do the registration. You can use the same
credentials you created in the previous section.

.. code:: python

    from azure.mgmt.resource.resources import ResourceManagementClient

    resource_client = ResourceManagementClient(
        credentials,
        subscription_id
    )
    resource_client.providers.register('Microsoft.Storage')
